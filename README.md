## Pandas in-app purchase analysis

This Activity involved analysing purchase data from a mobile app.  I used the Pandas library in a jupyter notebook to genrate a report that broke down the data into meaninful insignts.  I used the data to create tables that summarized and calculated inportant details about the game’s activity.  detail like:

* Player Count
* Purchasing Analysis (Total)
* Number of Unique Items
* Average Purchase Price
* Total Number of Purchases
* Total Revenue
* Gender Demographics
* Purchasing Analysis
* Age Demographics
* Top Spenders
* Most Popular Items
* Most Profitable Items

Here are a couple examples of the code and assosiated tables.  the full Jupyter notebook file (titled "HerosOfPymoli”) is located above.
